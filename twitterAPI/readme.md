# TwitterAPI

The Twitter API is an official tool for accessing large quantities of tweets and certain information in their contents in a professional and more efficient way. It requires 
a set of liscence keys. Including this liscence key directly may be difficult, and might malfunction on a different terminal due to file path differences. 
So I made an interface allowing the user to input the keys.

The main body of the code is the result of Prateek Mehta, with a certain degree of my modification.
